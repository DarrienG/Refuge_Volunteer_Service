Refuge Volunteer Service is an Android application that allows for residents of
Greece to help refugees in need who are using our parent service, CentRefuge.

Users of CentRefuge send text messages with basic information about themselves.
Where they are, what they need, their number, and general location.

In turn, users of Refuge Volunteer Service are able to pull down these requests
and take them into their own hands, helping residents who live nearby to them.
